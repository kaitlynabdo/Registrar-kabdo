How to run: make realclean make all


The program: Simulates a registrar's office using a DLL based queue. The specifications of the program will be read in from a file from the command line. Students will have a wait in a queue until a window is ready. Students are taken in on a first come first serve basis and contain information for how long they need at the window. At the end, the program prints to the console metrics about the results of the registrar's office.
